# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Presentation-using-OpenCV

## Objective 
I wanted to create an open cv project with which I can use my hand to control the way slides move in a presentation. Also, I wanted to draw and highlight important things on the slides during presentation using the hand gestures itself. I never wanted those drawings to stay on the slides after moving from one slide to another.

## Methodology
The first requirement of this project is to have a presentation which contains slides. So, I made a presentation with the help of canva which contained 5 slides in the with the size 1280 * 720. Then I downloaded that presentation file as images of the format PNG and saved in a folder named presentation.
